# New Contacts

Built using **Swift, iOS 8.4, Xcode 6.4**

This is the source code for a WIP app, 'New Contacts'.

New Contacts uses your address book (AddressBook framework) to access contacts, and sort by most recent.
Contacts can be filtered based on critera, such as, added during your working day (9-5pm) or weekend.
Those contacts added during social hours, outside of work, hold more importance than other contacts.

-

Currently a functional demostration of Swift, AddressBook and the concept.
There is no filtering, or custom interface, just standard UIKit controls.
